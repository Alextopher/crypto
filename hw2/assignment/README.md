# Assignment 2

This directory includes a copy of the assigment. a2.cipher is the file that contains the ciphertext. Each ascii character is encrypted with the public key. a2.pubkeys is the file that contains the public key, the first number is the modulus, the second number is the exponent.

Spoiler warning. The ipython notebook I used to decrypt the ciphertext is a2.ipynb.
