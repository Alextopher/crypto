## Part 1 (decrpytion)
I decrpyted this message mostly by hand partnered with [sophiacarlone](https://github.com/sophiacarlone). We used some ngram frequencies to help with our analysis.

## Part 2 (different secret key encryption)

I used a linear shift feedback register as a psuedo random number generator to create a stream cipher. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register

If you don't have the go compiler you can find download instructions at https://go.dev/doc/install. 

Running `make` is the easiest way to compile and test the program. It will create a new random key (a uint64), encrypt `message.txt` into `cipher.txt` and decrypt `cipher.txt` into `plaintext.txt`. Afterwards it runs `diff` to check if the decrypted message is the same as the original message.
