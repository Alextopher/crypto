# Crypto

This is all the software and my submissions for my Cryptography (CS456) course I took in Spring 2022. 

**Disclaimer:** If you're a student currently enrolled in this course, you will not learn that much from looking at this repo. Your professor can support you, and there are better sources of information online. The other online sources also probably do not violate your academic integrity.

## Explanation

For all of the assignments, we were presented with an encrypted file. The assignments were basically "decrypt this file and then do what it tells you to do." There was no programming language requirement. For homework 1 and homework 2, I broke the files using python in an ipynb. All other parts I completed in [go](https://go.dev/). Every homework assignment has its README.md explaining what the assignment was and how I solved it.

## Warning

Under no circumstances should you use these implementations of cryptographic systems in any production environment. I'm _positive_ there are problems in my implementations and probably more issues I don't know about. Stick to go's standard library implementations.
